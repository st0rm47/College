Maybe noone has told you this before, maybe me myself hasn't been able to do it for you.
But i want you to know that, 
I'll be there for the highs and lows
Give you mine if your heart gets broke
By your side when you're all alone
I will be there for you

# To create Bouncing Ball in Macromedia Director

## Objective
- To create a bouncing ball animation in Macromedia Director.
- To understand the basic principles of animation and motion in digital media.

## Introduction
Bouncing ball animations are a classic exercise in animation and motion graphics. They involve creating a ball that moves in a realistic and dynamic manner, bouncing off surfaces and changing direction based on physics principles. The animation of a bouncing ball can be used to demonstrate key concepts such as gravity, momentum, and elasticity.
