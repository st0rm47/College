# To create Bouncing Ball in Macromedia Director

## Objective
- To create a bouncing ball animation in Macromedia Director.
- To understand the basic principles of animation and motion in digital media.

## Introduction
Bouncing ball animations are a classic exercise in animation and motion graphics. They involve creating a ball that moves in a realistic and dynamic manner, bouncing off surfaces and changing direction based on physics principles. The animation of a bouncing ball can be used to demonstrate key concepts such as gravity, momentum, and elasticity.

## Materials
- Software: Macromedia Director

## Procedure
1. Open Macromedia Director and create a new project.
2. Create a new sprite.
3. Use the paint tools to draw a ball on the stage.
4. Set the initial position and size of the ball.
5. Create a new cast member for the ball.
6. Add a script to the ball sprite to control its movement.
7. Use the Lingo scripting language to define the ball's behavior, including its speed, direction, and bounce.

## Output
<div align="center">
  <img src="BouncingBall.gif" alt="Bouncing Ball" width="400" >
</div>
