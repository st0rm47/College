# To create logo design in Macro media Freehand MX 11

## Introduction
Logo design is a creative process where art meets strategy to build a brand's visual identity. 
A good logo design is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both print and digital. 
It should be scalable, able to be reproduced in a variety of sizes, and effective in black and white. 

A logo can be in the form of an icon, a symbol, or a combination of text and imagery.
Graphics formats are used to store digital images. The most common formats are JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and TIFF. 
Each format has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

There are mainly two types of graphics:
- Raster graphics: Raster or Bitmap graphics are made up of pixels. They are resolution dependent and ideal for photographs.
