# To create a bouncing ball animation in Macromedia Flash

## Objectives
- To create a bouncing ball animation in Macromedia Flash
- To understand the basic concepts of animation in Macromedia Flash

## Introduction
Animation in Macromedia Flash combines graphics and timeline-based movements to create dynamic scenes. 
Computer based animations are created by changing the position of objects over time. 
This process involves creating keyframes at different intervals on the timeline.

Key frames are crucial in creating animations. They are the frames where the content changes.
The timeline is where you can see the keyframes and the content of the animation.
The timeline is divided into frames, and each frame represents a specific point in time. 
By moving objects between keyframes, you can create smooth transitions in your animations.
