> # Domain Names, DNS and URLs
#### Domain Names
- A domain name is a human-readable address for a website (e.g., `example.com`).
- It replaces the need to remember IP addresses.
- Domains are organized hierarchically (e.g., `www` is a subdomain of `example.com`).
- They are registered through domain registrars and must be unique.

#### DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can load websites.
- It acts as the internet's phonebook.
- DNS servers handle this translation process.
- Example: `example.com` → `192.168.1.1`.

#### URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
- A URL is the complete address used to access a specific resource on the web.
- It consists of:
    - **Protocol**: `http://` or `https://`.
    - **Domain Name**: `example.com`.
    - **Path**: `/about` (optional).
- Example: `https://example.com/about`.
- URLs are used to locate web pages, files, or services online.

---

> # HTTP
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is how data is shared on the web.
- It works on a request-response system: clients (browsers) ask for data, and servers send it back.
- HTTP is stateless, meaning it doesn't remember past requests.
- Common methods: GET (fetch), POST (send), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).
- It usually uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds encryption for safer data transfer.

#### Working of HTTP:
1. User enters a URL in the browser.
2. Browser uses DNS to find the server's IP address.
3. Browser opens TCP connection to the server.
4. Browser sends an HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.) to the server.
5. Server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
6. Browser receives the response and displays the content.
